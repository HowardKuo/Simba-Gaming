Team Fortress 2
Why is Team Fortress 2 the ultimate online FPS experience? You mean besides the fact that it's a steadily updated, viciously stylish, utterly outlandish shooter you can start playing instantly? Other than the pursuit of more hats, what makes TF 2 so playable over and over again? Its oh-so-varied class-based gameplay. Each class has such a distinct role it's like playing an entirely different game. The rocket jumping soldier smacks of Quake 3, the Scout's double jump reminds us of the original Unreal Tournament, and the Medic is like the bizarre Ghostbusters game we'll never have.
