Left 4 Dead 2
Since the dawn of the FPS, mankind has endeavored to blow zombie brains out the back's of digitized zombie skulls. Eventually it seemed that gamers would tire of murdering undead fiend after undead fiend, but leave it to Valve to find a new way to make it interesting again: four player co-op multiplayer, and let the people play as zombies.Left 4 Dead 2 built on basics established by the original L4D, introducing new playable infected types, melee weapons and a bold new New Orleans setting. But most importantly, it kept an emphasis on survival horror, forcing players to make split second life or death decisions. Who gets that last health pack? Do we go back for that injured teammate, or make a desperate three man sprint for the exit? The choice, unfortunately, is yours.

Spartans can now sprint, carry custom loadouts straight into battle, and even earn rewarding Ordinance Drops. A variety of new weapons have been added as well, thanks to the inclusion of the energy-based Promethean soldiers seen throughout the thrilling campaign. But standard multiplayer isn't the only way to get some frag time with friends; Halo 4's co-op mode, Spartan Ops, offers some of the most ambitious features in recent shooter history. Players in groups of up to four can complete story-based missions, battling tough Covenant and Promethean foes.

Counter Strike: Source
Counter Strike is the granddaddy of online shooters. So many popular mods and game modes have been birthed from the old-school Half-Life mod. Some newer shooters are only now adding modes similar to CS's Gun Game mod and many others are still trying to capture the essence of what Counter-Strike had. Not only was it well ahead of its time, it is still enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of players today.To Counter-Strike purists, it still might be preferable to stay out of the source engine, but to do so means missing out on those enhanced visuals from the early 2000s, the fancy ragdoll physics and one of the best CS maps in existence, Office. So, naturally, we decided on the title's updated version.
