Fallout 3 
Fallout 3 marked a shift in the industry, a move that saw the western RPG begin to surpass its Japanese counterparts. Fallout 3 is a massive game set in an equally massive open world where you can go in any direction you like and do anything you want to do... as long as you can survive long enough to do so, that is. Set in a post-apocalyptic American wasteland rife with memorable characters, Fallout 3 is the epitome of the deep, modern RPG and the archetype that many developers will mimic moving forward.

Mass Effect 
The developers at BioWare found something special when creating Mass Effect. Not only did they manage to fashion a believable galaxy filled with alien life, but they charted hundreds of years into our fictional future. As humanity struggles to find its place amidst more advanced races, a whispered threat sparks fear and uncertainty throughout the universe. The capable Commander Shepard takes center stage, serving as the player's avatar and moral outlet for a quest of choice and consequence. Mass Effect helped usher in a new generation of RPGs and did so with riveting conversation, difficult decisions, and a haunting chat with a near-dead AI beneath the surface of Ilos.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 
How easy it was to spend an afternoon, a weekend, a month, in the world of Skyrim. Like its Elder Scrolls predecessors, Skyrim contained a massive land to explore -- a land teeming with quests, characters, and treasure. Considering the gaming community's loving reception of Skyrim, from complex mods to cover ballads, gamers clearly appreciate a quest they control. The open-ended nature of the plot and play facilitates a nearly endless number of characters to create. Venomous archers and armored spell casters make up just a few of the roles players define for themselves in Skyrim. All while marching through the snow in time with Jeremy Soule's unforgettable Dragonborn theme.

Diablo II
Arguably the best of the three Diablo games, part II took everything that its hackin' slashin' lootin' predecessor hit on and expanded it. For starters, the campaign is much, much longer. Four lengthy Acts spanned the same number of artistically diverse locations. Meanwhile, a whopping five character classes made the game play very differently depending on which hero you chose. Co-op play was a dream, and item trading founded a subculture within the online community. To this end, Diablo II was almost endlessly replayable, which made the 12-year wait between this and Diablo III a lot more bearable. For many (including us), Diablo II remains the high-water mark of the action-RPG genre, even given its age.

Final Fantasy IV
Before Tidus and Yuna danced through water, before Cloud faced Sephiroth, before the World of Balance fell to ruin, Cecil fought his inner darkness in Final Fantasy IV. A pivotal entry in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy IV featured the deeds and daring of fantastic characters, including a brooding Dragoon, a loyal pair of twins, a forgetful mystic, and an orphaned summoner. But this memorable cast waged war in equally memorable battles. Final Fantasy IV ushered the ATB (Active Time Battle) system into the series and changed the way Final Fantasy games were played for years. And its simple 2D sprites, sweeping music, and timeless themes will, without question, endure for decades to come.

Pokemon Red/Blue
Pokemon Red and Blue weren't just a set of amazingly inventive and fun role playing games - they were also the start of a revolution. Pushing portable connectivity like no other game before it, Pokemon caused a global sensation, one that is still alive and well more than 16 years after the original game's release. With the lure of catching all 151 monsters, the unforgettable journey from Pallet Town to Victory Road, and the challenge to be the very best, Pokemon achieved incredible popularity across the globe, and has helped popularize the RPG genre like no other. No matter how much the series has progressed since its 8-bit days, the enormous impact of Pokemon can never be forgotten - as the genre wouldn't be what it is today without it.
